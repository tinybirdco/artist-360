## Reproducing this project on your Tinybird account

### Authenticate

Run `tb auth`. You'll be asked your admin key, which will be saved in a `.tinyb` file

### Push the Data Sources and pipes to your account

First, you should create a Kafka Data Source. Contact us at hi@tinybird.co to learn how to do it, as it's functional already but we haven't released this yet.

Then, running `tb push`, all yoru Data Sources, materializations and endpoints should be replicated in your account.
